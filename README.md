PART 2 - READ ME
Overview: This is my website for my store called 'Belle Noire', which is a modern high-end luxury clothing store that aims to cater to women aged between 20-55 with a high interest in high fashion and that have a disposable income. We house exquiste dresses,shoes, and handbags that can easily take you from Marbella brunches to dinners at Le Meurice in Paris.
